intro:
  title@: Improve user engagement with fast, compelling experiences.
  paragraph@: Web page speed improves the user experience and <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/">core business metrics</a>. AMP pages load near instantly enabling you to offer a consistently fast experience across all devices and platforms that link to AMP Pages including Google, Bing, LinkedIn and more. These performance gains often translate in improvements in the numbers that matter, such as time spent on page, return visits and CTRs.

why:
  title@: How AMP can help you
  reasons:
    - title@: Keep your audience engaged
      paragraph@: AMP pages typically load in under one second. That means when your target audience lands on an AMP page, they get what they’re looking for in the moment they’re looking for it. The net result -- they’re more likely to be engaged with and receptive to your brand’s messages, and more likely to take the actions you’re guiding them towards like completing a purchase.

    - title@: Maximize your revenue
      paragraph@: Conversions fall by 12 percent for every extra second a webpage takes to load. If you want people to engage with your brand and increase your sales and the performance of your campaigns, you have to speed things up. AMP offers a way for you to give users a faster experience everywhere -- on ads, landing pages or your entire website.

    - title@: Maintain flexibility and control
      paragraph@: Adopting the AMP format allows you to retain your own branding and tooling while taking advantage of AMP's optimized web components. You can use CSS to customize your styling, dynamic data to fetch the freshest data where needed, and A/B testing to experiment and build the best possible user experience for your customers.

    - title@: Reduce complexity in your operations
      paragraph@: Building AMP pages is simple and straightforward. You can often convert your entire archive in days especially if you use a popular CMS such as Wordpress and Drupal. Your teams do not need any special skills nor worry about optimizing your code for each distribution platform as the AMP format is fully portable and AMP pages are consistently fast no matter how a user gets to them.

With AMPHTML Ads, your ads can serve on both AMP and non-AMP pages, meaning you can build your ads once and deliver a memorable brand experience everywhere.
